 * See documentation: [useTimer](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usetimer--page)
 *
 * A versatile precision timer hook for React. Doubles as a stopwatch.
 *
 * - Based on `setTimeout()` and timestamps, not `setInterval()` or ticks.
 * - Features perfect mean interval accuracy, meaning it doesn't wander.
 * - Resilient to expensive callback operations and low timer delays.
 * - Can be used as a timer or a stopwatch.
 * - Supports starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming.
 * - Includes accessors for everything under the sun.
 *
 * @param options The TimerOptions for the timer.
 * @param callback The callback to call when the timer fires. Use React.useCallback() for this. Must provide a `delay` for the timer to fire. If you'd like, you can determine if any calls were missed by checking the `overdueCallCount` argument. This value will indicate how many calls were missed due to a very short timer delay or time-consuming callback.
