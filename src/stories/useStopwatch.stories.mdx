<h1>useStopwatch</h1>

## Description

This convenience hook creates a stopwatch using [useTimer](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usetimer--docs). A stopwatch tracks time when started and can be paused, resumed, and stopped.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useStopwatch } from 'react-use-precision-timer';
```

In your function component:

```jsx
const stopwatch = useStopwatch();
```

Use `start()`, `stop()`, `pause()`, and `resume()` to control the stopwatch.

Stopwatch is a [Timer](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usetimer--docs#timer) object. Refer to Timer's getters to retrieve elapsed running time, paused time, and so forth.

Calling start while a stopwatch is already running will restart it.

## Signature

`useStopwatch() => Timer`

### Props

This hook takes no props.

### Return

The hook returns a [Timer](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usetimer--docs#timer) that behaves like a stopwatch.

## Demo

Go to the [useTimer demo](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-demo--docs) and set the delay to `0`. This will turn the timer into a stopwatch.
