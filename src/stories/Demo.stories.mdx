<h1>Demo</h1>

The following is a demo of the [useTimer](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usetimer--docs) hook (which the [useDelay](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usedelay--docs) and [useStopwatch](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usestopwatch--docs) hooks wrap).

- You can [start, stop, pause, and resume](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usetimer--docs#mutators) the timer.
- You can also configure the delay and other [timer options](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usetimer--docs#timeroptions).
- All [getters](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usetimer--docs#getters) are shown so you can see what's happening under the hood. Times are in milliseconds.
- When the timer fires, the "Callback time" is updated to the current time.
- The "Render every X ms" setting allows you to choose how often the demo renders when the timer isn't firing.
- Set the delay to 0 to turn the timer into a [stopwatch](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usestopwatch--docs).
